# Tick-It
A Movie Ticket Booking System built for the course CSE3002 Internet and Web Programming

------
## Aim & Objective
The aim of the project is to make a fully functioning movie ticket booking website through which Admins can add theatres, movies and shows and then Users can book tickets. 

The purpose of this project was to create a functioning webpage for both user and admin side, for a movie booking system, wherein the details about shows and theatres, as well as timings and prices, could be entered by the admin, on the same site as the user, depending on the login. This allows for more ease-of-access, as well as ease-of-use, and it is aimed at being as user friendly and convenient as possible.

## Conclusion
After the completion of this project, we were able to understand and have a better grasp on what actually goes into designing a website. The primary hitches we faced were in the overall display of the website, which was handled over time, with feedback, and we learned the backend for this project while going through it. Overall, this project has contributed to our growth and development, and due to it, we understand the code that goes “under the hood”, or behind the scenes of each website, so to speak. 

A possible limitation and scope for the future would be to include a Payment portal wherein the user is redirected to their preferred payment service and then back to a Successful Payment page. We can also work on encrypting said payment procedure.
